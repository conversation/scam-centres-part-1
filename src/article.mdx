Ben Yeo found himself trapped in a scam centre in Cambodia in early 2024. He was sending text messages of a different sort, plotting his escape.

## How did Ben end up there?

Ben Yeo was a self-made businessman from Malaysia who had travelled all over South-East Asia for work  organising government investment conferences in Cambodia and Myanmar. 

In early 2024, he and his Filipino wife Moira began looking for a new opportunity in Cambodia.

They thought they got lucky right away: a recruitment agency was hiring staff for a casino in the town of Bavet, near the Vietnamese border. 

The company was called AsiaHR International Co. Ltd. Ben did some research, and everything seemed to check out. It was registered and had a recruitment license from the Cambodian government.

  caption='A scam job ad from Facebook in Vietnamese'
/> 

They both negotiated new jobs, Ben doing business development and Moira as a card dealer in the casino.

When they arrived at the compound in February of last year, however, Ben got a bad feeling. As he told The Conversation in a podcast interview:

<Pullquote className='' quote="It had these tall walls, barbed wire and cameras everywhere. […] And when we got into the compound, we were told we weren't allowed to get out." />

<Pullquote className='' quote="Then they said, I'm sorry, this whole thing, it's not a casino. This is not a casino industry. As a matter of fact, we are doing scams." startQuoteIcon={false} />

<Pullquote className='' quote="We were very taken aback. I was quite upset because we let go of my home in Malaysia and we were really prepared for work, we wanted to do something legitimate" startQuoteIcon={false} />

<Pullquote className='py-5 pb-8 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="I remember telling my wife that we have to sort of get through this with a soft approach. We can't fight our way through the gates, you know?" startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true} />

Ben and Moira aren’t alone. There are many more victims in the industry across South-East Asia. 

In 2023, at least 120,000 people were believed to have been forced into criminality in scam centres in Myanmar and another 100,000 in Cambodia, according to a report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. This figure, however, remains contested and difficult to verify, as the industry is very volatile and there is simply no way to know how many people are in the compounds willingly.

## How we know about this

The two of us, alongside our third research partner, Mark Bo, have been investigating the scam industry in Cambodia for years. Our research will be published in a book in  mid-2025, [Scam: Inside Southeast Asia’s Cybercrime Compounds](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/775556/scam-by-ivan-franceschini-ling-li-and-mark-bo/).

We rely heavily on in-depth interviews that Ling conducted between 2022 and 2024 with nearly 100 survivors of compounds mostly located in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Through their words, we've been able to document the inner workings of the industry and what the victims endure inside the compounds.

Because the industry is hidden behind high walls mounted with barbed wire and surveillance cameras, we’ve also spent countless hours tracking the scammers online. We've scoured Telegram channels and messages, online job advertisement websites and social media platforms to understand how criminal groups lure people into the industry.

      We also hired a photographer to get a [rare, inside look](https://globalchinapulse.net/sihanoukville-rise-and-fall-of-a-frontier-city/) at several compounds in Cambodia that had been temporarily abandoned by scammers in the wake of a short-lived crackdown in late 2022, as well as aerial images using drones.

    </ScrollTextChapter>
  </ScrollForeground>
</ScrollSection>

Once inside, some decide to stay of their own volition, while others realise they can no longer leave. 

And some, like Ben, are duped from the very beginning. They may be lured into the industry by promising job offers, or trafficked through more violent means. 

This blurred line between a willingness to cause harm to others and coercion has turned public opinion against many who were genuinely trafficked into the industry. People don't believe they are genuine victims.

## ‘My children were starving’

Desperation plays a fundamental role for both those who enter willingly and those lured through phony job offers. These people often find themselves in dire financial straits and believe the scam world is a path to easy money. 

People trapped in the compounds come from all walks of life. While there is no lack of skilled personnel inside scam operations, many, if not most workers, do not have specific language or IT skills. Many of the victims we interviewed from mainland China, for example, are referred to by police as the "three lows" (_san di_), meaning they have low income, education and age. Their options for legitimate employment are limited.

This is confirmed by our findings. In an [online survey](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12117-024-09552-2) we conducted in 2023 with 62 survivors from mainland China, more than half were under the age of 25. Just under half had only a middle school education, while some had even less. They were overwhelmingly men. 

Several of our interviewees also said they turned to scamming due to financial strain, in many cases related to the COVID pandemic. For instance, a Chinese restaurant owner who lost his business in 2021 told us:

<Pullquote className='' quote='I didn’t care if it was Cambodia or Colombia: I really needed a job.' />

<Pullquote className='' quote="The day after I accepted the [scam recruiter's] offer, the company moved very quickly and bought me a ticket to Phnom Penh." startQuoteIcon={false} />

<Pullquote className='' quote="At that point, my children were starving. […] I really could not afford to be unemployed anymore." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true} />

## Duped by false promises 

Many victims fall for deceptive, vague-sounding ads on job-recruitment websites or social media. 

**VIS: image of job ad**
{/* <img src='./job ads in Vietnamese.jpeg' alt=''/> */}

Telegram is a particularly popular platform for recruiters. The jobs often sound like legitimate opportunities in customer service, sales or promotions. Some ads, however, are for jobs in sectors as diverse as construction, food and tourism. 

There are often promises of high salaries, year-end bonuses and promotion opportunities. Yet, many ads have minimal skill requirements, such as basic computer literacy and fluency in a specific language. This is a red flag, as is the offer to cover food, accommodation and travel expenses. 

Other people are also lured into the industry by brokers, who are typically paid a fee by the scam company. This then becomes a debt the victim or their family must pay later to secure their freedom.  

And some are duped by people in their social circles,acquaintances or even relatives. 

One 19-year-old Chinese man we interviewed, Xiaozan (pseudonym), lost his job on a construction site in Cambodia during the pandemic. A co-worker from his region of China offered him a maintenance job at a new compound. Once he arrived, however, his passport was confiscated, he was severely beaten and he was eventually sold to five scamming centres.

## Life inside

Life is hell inside the compounds. Victims are often ruthlessly exploited because they begin their "jobs" with a massive debt – the money used to cover possible flight tickets, visas and work permits, in addition to brokers or traffickers. 

These debts only rise the longer they are held. Even though scammers are usually paid a nominal monthly salary, their accommodation, food and other expenses are generally not covered. The image below shows the bill for a worker in a scam compound in Cambodia, who was charged for the portion of the floor he "consumed", usage of the toilet and even the "seaside air" he breathed.

  caption='Internet fraud companies charge their employees all sorts of fees, including "toilet usage fees", "sea view air fees", "floor wear and tear fees", etc'
/>

Victims also have to work punishing hours. One of our interviewees had to juggle more than ten phones at his compound in the Cambodian scam hub of Sihanoukville from 7am to midnight if the targets were in Asia, or from 1am to 4pm if the targets were in the United States. He worked seven days a week.

In many compounds, the shifts begin with everyone chanting a slogan, like:

<Pullquote className='' quote='Two hands typing on a keyboard can earn you billions in gold; work hard on marketing and you will win. Go for it!' />

But only a lucky few actually "win". The performance benchmarks they are expected to meet are extremely high. One employee in a Cambodian compound told us they were expected to generate US$10,000 (A$16,000) in revenue each month and bring in two to three new victims a day. 

The most successful employees are held up as models for the rest. Some compounds give them lucrative bonuses and the chance to move up the "corporate" ladder to become a team leader or manager.

One scammer named Tao (pseudonym) told us it was akin to brainwashing, "to push our moral limits".

<Pullquote className='' quote='The ‘excellent employee’ would get monetary awards, promotions, and, sometimes, the privilege to temporarily exit the compound. If you were one of them, they would buy you good food and take you to gamble or even pay for prostitutes to let you taste their rich life.' />

For those who cannot meet their targets, life quickly becomes a nightmare. In the compound where Tao was trapped, these workers were beaten, subjected to electric shocks and in some cases even had their nails extracted.

<Pullquote className='' quote='We could hear the screams continuing until midnight […] They made sure you understand that you do not want to be the next one to end up in the punishment room.' />

Some even endure sexual violence. A Taiwanese woman named Alice told us that when she refused to engage in scam work, she was sold numerous times between compounds and repeatedly raped. Before she was finally rescued, the gangsters threatened to lock her up in a brothel-like clubhouse at a scam compound to serve at the pleasure of the managers and workforce. We have also come across testimonies of victims – both men and women – who were forced to perform sexual acts on each other as a form of punishment.

One of the most harrowing aspects of life inside the compounds is the potential to be sold like a slave to the highest bidder. 

According to our interviews, skilled workers fluent in Mandarin fetched as much as US$10,000–15,000 (A$16,000–24,000) in Sihanoukville in 2022. In Myanmar, this rate could be double given the logistical challenges of getting them into a country embroiled in a civil war.

## What happened to Ben and Moira?

For two weeks, Ben and Moira sat at their desks, refusing to make calls.

The threats escalated.

<Pullquote className='' quote='They said …they would rape my wife if I do not sit and answer phone calls.' />

<Pullquote className='pt-5 pb-9 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote='They tried all kinds of coercive manoeuvres, you know, using a fire extinguisher to [pretend] to hit me to scare me, using a plastic bag over my head to suffocate me.' startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true}/>

Then Ben was separated from his wife. He was forced to sit in a chair facing a wall with a knife positioned between his legs.

The next day, he was moved to a locked room and the scam bosses ordered Ben and Moira to phone their families to demand a US$10,000 (A$16,000) "penalty" apiece to allow them to walk free. 

<Pullquote className='' quote="It's a combination between a prison and a madhouse. So the walls are like padded with, I think, four-inch pads. If you start screaming in there, no one will be able to hear you." />

<Pullquote className='pt-5 pb-9 text-red-50 text-xl sm:text-2xl text-balance text-center' quote="And in the room, there's only one railing, which is half a foot above the ground. And basically they handcuffed me on that railing. So I wasn't even able to stand up and they were starving me, depriving me of toilets, water, food." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true}/>

After eight days, help finally arrived. Ben's father alerted the Malaysian embassy in Phnom Penh, the capital, and the local police intervened. But little did he know, securing their freedom would be a harrowing ordeal, with the scam centre loathe to let them go.
