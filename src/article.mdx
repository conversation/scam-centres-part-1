Ben Yeo is trapped in a scam centre in Cambodia, desperately trying to escape. It's early 2024 and he's been here for 30 days.

30 days since Ben and his wife Moira realised their well-paid new casino jobs were just an elaborate ruse.

Now they have to choose: pay their captors a US$20,000 ransom or get to work in the scam compound.

## Walking into a trap

In early 2024, Ben and Moira were looking for jobs in Cambodia.

They saw a recruitment agency was hiring staff for a casino in the town of Bavet, near the Vietnamese border.

  loading='lazy'
  alt='A scam job ad from WhatsApp.'
  source='Source: Author provided'
  caption='The scam job ad that lured Ben and Moira to Cambodia.'
/> 

Ben did some research on the company and everything seemed to check out. It was registered and had a recruitment licence from the Cambodian government.

They both negotiated new jobs, Ben doing business development and Moira as a card dealer in the casino.

From the moment they arrived at the compound Ben had a bad feeling. Then his new employers told him he wasn't allowed to leave.

<Pullquote className='' quote="They said, I'm sorry, this whole thing, it's not a casino. This is not a casino industry. As a matter of fact, we are doing scams."  />

Ben and Moira aren’t alone. Experts estimate there are hundreds of thousands of scammers in the industry across Southeast Asia. Some of them are unrepentant criminals, ruthlessly exploiting victims across the world. Others are victims themselves, trafficked and held against their will. Others still are desperate people willing to participate in the industry to survive.

## On the trail of the scammers

As academic researchers, we've spent the past XX years interviewing these people to understand their motivations and the inner workings of the booming scam industry.

We have spoken to nearly 100 people from compounds mostly located in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

/>  */}

## Predators or prey 

Those who become trapped in the compounds come from all walks of life. Many scammers are what Chinese authorities refer to as "_san di_" ("three lows"), meaning they have low income, education and age. Desperation drives many of them. As one former scammer told us:

<Pullquote className='' quote='I didn’t care if it was Cambodia or Colombia: I really needed a job.' />

<Pullquote className='' quote="At that point, my children were starving. […] I really could not afford to be unemployed anymore." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true} />

Many are lured by vague-sounding ads on job-recruitment websites or social media, while others are directly targeted.

Telegram is a popular platform for recruiters. The jobs often sound like legitimate opportunities in customer service, sales or promotions. Some ads, though, are for jobs in sectors as diverse as construction, food and tourism. Recently a well-known Chinese actor was [even lured](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/china/china-actor-thailand-scam-myanmar-intl-hnk/index.html) to Thailand for a fake movie casting call and ended up in a Myanmar scam compound.

<Tweet1 />

There are often promises of high salaries, year-end bonuses and promotion opportunities. Yet, many ads have minimal skill requirements, such as basic computer literacy and fluency in a specific language. This is a red flag. As is the offer to cover food, accommodation and travel expenses.

<JobAdTranslation />

Others are tempted into the industry through brokers, who may spend months building personal connections with their victims before approaching them with an “unmissable” job opportunity. They are typically paid a fee by the scam company, which then becomes a debt the victim or their family must later pay to secure their freedom. 

Some are duped by people in their social circles, friends or even relatives. Other victims are kidnapped right off the street. During the pandemic, out of work gangsters turned to kidnapping people for scam operations to make a living.

## Punishment and manipulation

Victims often begin their new "jobs" with a massive debt for flights, visas, permits and broker or trafficker fees.

These debts grow the longer they are held, with accommodation, food and even "seaside air" added to their final bill.

Newcomers must also be instructed in how to pull off a scam. Some are highly scripted frauds that require intensive training and dedicated phrasebooks.

The time involved in approaching a victim and earning their trust can sometimes take months. Here's how one scammer tricked a victim in China over WhatsApp, texting daily and presenting himself as a successful cryptocurrency investor.

In many compounds, the shifts begin with everyone chanting a slogan, such as:

<Pullquote className='' quote='Two hands typing on a keyboard can earn you billions in gold; work hard on marketing and you will win. Go for it!' />

But very few actually "win". Their performance benchmarks are extremely high. One employee in a Cambodian compound told us they were expected to generate US$10,000 (A$16,000) in revenue each month and entice two to three new victims a day.

The most successful employees are held up as models. One former scammer, Tao, told us it's akin to brainwashing.

<Pullquote className='' quote='The ‘excellent employee’ would get monetary awards, promotions, and, sometimes, the privilege to temporarily exit the compound. If you were one of them, they would buy you good food and take you to gamble or even pay for prostitutes to let you taste their rich life.' />

For those who cannot meet their targets, life quickly becomes a nightmare. They were beaten, subjected to electric shocks and even had their nails extracted.

<Pullquote className='' quote='We could hear the screams continuing until midnight […] They made sure you understand that you do not want to be the next one to end up in the punishment room.' />

Sexual violence is rife. A Taiwanese woman named Alice told us that when she refused to engage in scam work, she was sold numerous times between compounds and repeatedly raped. Before she was finally rescued, the gangsters threatened to lock her up in a brothel-like clubhouse at a scam compound to serve at the pleasure of the managers and workforce. Male victims are forced to perform sexual acts on each other as a form of punishment.

/> 

Another harrowing aspect of life inside the compounds is the potential to be sold like a slave to the highest bidder.

Skilled workers fluent in Mandarin can fetch anywhere between US$10,000-30,000.

## Getting out

Ben is eventually separated from his wife and locked in a room by himself.

<Pullquote className='' quote="It's a combination between a prison and a madhouse. So the walls are like padded with, I think, four-inch pads. If you start screaming in there, no one will be able to hear you." />

<Pullquote className='' quote="And in the room, there's only one railing, which is half a foot above the ground. And basically they handcuffed me on that railing. So I wasn't even able to stand up and they were starving me, depriving me of toilets, water, food." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true}/>

His family doesn't pay the ransom, though. They go to the Malaysian embassy in Cambodia instead. And eight days after Ben was put in isolation, the police finally arrive.

Ben and Moira's ordeal doesn't end there, however. When they give their statement to the police, they are astonished to see a negotiator for the scam company in the room. Ben fears the police may be compromised.

With the help of a well-connected family friend in Cambodia, they are eventually transferred to another police station. The scam company follows them there, too, and offers them a bribe in exchange for their silence.

The questioning by Cambodian authorities continues for weeks. Ben doesn't understand why he and Moira aren't being treated by victims.

<Pullquote className='' quote="The human trafficking department was constantly seeking areas of which they can press charges on me." />

<Pullquote className='' quote="From a victim of kidnapping, I become the perpetrator." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true}/>

Eventually, he and Moira are deemed victims of human trafficking and are taken to a shelter run by a nongovernmental organisation. Three months later, the group finally arranges tickets for them to return home.

_Tomorrow, in part 3, we will explain how scamming has exploded overnight to become a multi-billion-dollar industry._
