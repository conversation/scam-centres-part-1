Ben Yeo was a self-made businessman from Malaysia who had travelled all over Southeast Asia for work – organising government investment conferences in Cambodia and Myanmar. But by early 2024, he found himself trapped in a scam centre in Cambodia, desperately trying to escape.

## How did Ben end up there?

In early 2024, Ben and his Filipino wife Moira were looking for a new opportunity in Cambodia.

They thought they got lucky right away: a recruitment agency was hiring staff for a casino in the town of Bavet, near the Vietnamese border. 

Ben did some research on the company and everything seemed to check out. It was registered and had a recruitment licence from the Cambodian government.

They both negotiated new jobs, Ben doing business development and Moira as a card dealer in the casino.

When they arrived at the compound in February last year, however, Ben got a bad feeling. As he told The Conversation in a podcast series accompanying:

Ben and Moira aren’t alone. There are many more victims in the industry across Southeast Asia. 

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reports that in 2023, at least 120,000 people were forced into criminality in scam centres in Myanmar and another 100,000 in Cambodia. This figure, however, remains contested and difficult to verify, as the industry is very volatile. There is simply no way to know how many people are in these compounds willingly.

## How we know about this

The two of us, alongside our research partner, Mark Bo, have been investigating the scam industry in Cambodia for years. Our research will be published in a book in mid-2025, [Scam: Inside Southeast Asia’s Cybercrime Compounds](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/775556/scam-by-ivan-franceschini-ling-li-and-mark-bo/).

We rely heavily on in-depth interviews Ling conducted between 2022 and 2024 with nearly 100 survivors of compounds mostly located in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Through their words, we've been able to document the inner workings of the industry and the conditions that victims are forced to endure inside the compounds.

      Many people enter the industry willingly, knowing they will scam unwitting victims around the world. Once inside, some decide to stay of their own volition, while others realise they can no longer leave.

</ScrollSection>

And some, like Ben, are duped from the very beginning through promising job offers, or trafficked through more violent means.

This blurred line between a willingness to cause harm and coercion has turned public opinion against many who were trafficked into the industry. People don't believe they are genuine victims.

## ‘My children were starving’

Desperation drives many people into the scamming world, whether willingly or not. 

Those who become trapped in the compounds come from all walks of life. While there's no lack of skilled personnel inside scam operations, many have no language or IT skills whatsoever. This is particularly true for Chinese scam workers, whom the Chinese authorities refer to as the "three lows" (_san di_), meaning they have low income, education and age. As such, their options for legitimate employment are limited.

This is confirmed by our findings. In an [online survey](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12117-024-09552-2) we conducted in 2023 with 62 survivors from mainland China, more than half were under the age of 25. Just under half had only a middle school education, while some had even less. They were overwhelmingly men. 

Several of our interviewees also said they turned to scamming due to financial strain, in many cases related to the COVID pandemic. For instance, a Chinese restaurant owner who lost his business in 2021 told us:

<Pullquote className='' quote='I didn’t care if it was Cambodia or Colombia: I really needed a job.' />

<Pullquote className='' quote="The day after I accepted the [scam recruiter's] offer, the company moved very quickly and bought me a ticket to Phnom Penh." startQuoteIcon={false} />

<Pullquote className='' quote="At that point, my children were starving. […] I really could not afford to be unemployed anymore." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true} />

## Duped and kidnapped 

Many of those tricked into the industry fall for deceptive, vague-sounding ads on job-recruitment websites or social media. 

Telegram is a particularly popular platform for recruiters. The jobs often sound like legitimate opportunities in customer service, sales or promotions. Some ads, though, are for jobs in sectors as diverse as construction, food and tourism. Recently, a Chinese actor was [even lured](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/china/china-actor-thailand-scam-myanmar-intl-hnk/index.html) to Thailand for a fake movie casting call and ended up in a Myanmar scam compound.

<Tweet1 />

There are often promises of high salaries, year-end bonuses and promotion opportunities. Yet, many ads have minimal skill requirements, such as basic computer literacy and fluency in a specific language. This is a red flag. As is the offer to cover food, accommodation and travel expenses.

Others are tempted into the industry through brokers, who may spend months building personal connections with their victims before approaching them with an “unmissable” job opportunity. They are typically paid a fee by the scam company, which then becomes a debt the victim or their family must later pay to secure their freedom.  

Some are duped by people in their social circles, friends or even relatives. 

Xiaozan is a 19-year-old Chinese man we interviewed, who, like most of our survivors, requested we use a pseudonym. When he lost his job on a construction site in Cambodia during the pandemic, a co-worker from his region of China offered him a maintenance job at a new compound. Once he arrived, however, his passport was confiscated, he was severely beaten and he was eventually sold to five different scam centres. (*The names of victims in this story have been changed to protect their identities.)

And frighteningly, some victims are kidnapped right off the street. During the pandemic, for instance, gangsters hired by casinos in Cambodia to collect debts found themselves unemployed and turned to kidnapping people for scam operations to make a living. 

## ‘Billions in gold’ or torture

Life is hell [inside the compounds](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14672715.2023.2268104). Victims are often ruthlessly exploited because they begin their new "jobs" with a massive debt – the money used to cover possible flights, visas, permits, and broker or trafficker fees.

These debts only rise the longer they are held. Even though scammers are usually paid a nominal monthly salary, their accommodation, food and other expenses are generally not covered. The image below shows the bill for a worker in a scam compound in Cambodia, who was charged for the portion of the floor he "consumed", usage of the toilet and even the "seaside air" he breathed.

<SeverancePaymentBill />

Victims also have to work punishing hours. One of our interviewees had to juggle more than ten phones at his compound in the Cambodian scam hub of Sihanoukville from 7am to midnight if the targets were in Asia, or from 1am to 4pm if the targets were in the United States. He worked seven days a week.

In many compounds, the shifts begin with everyone chanting a slogan, such as:

<Pullquote className='' quote='Two hands typing on a keyboard can earn you billions in gold; work hard on marketing and you will win. Go for it!' />

But only a lucky few actually "win". The performance benchmarks they are expected to meet are extremely high. One employee in a Cambodian compound told us they were expected to generate US$10,000 (A$16,000) in revenue each month and entice two to three new victims a day.

/> 

The most successful employees are held up as models for the rest. Some compounds give them lucrative bonuses and the chance to move up the "corporate" ladder to become a team leader or manager.

One scammer named Tao told us it was akin to brainwashing, "to push our moral limits".

<Pullquote className='' quote='The ‘excellent employee’ would get monetary awards, promotions, and, sometimes, the privilege to temporarily exit the compound. If you were one of them, they would buy you good food and take you to gamble or even pay for prostitutes to let you taste their rich life.' />

For those who cannot meet their targets, life quickly becomes a nightmare. In the compound where Tao was trapped, workers were beaten, subjected to electric shocks and in some cases even had their nails extracted.

<Pullquote className='' quote='We could hear the screams continuing until midnight […] They made sure you understand that you do not want to be the next one to end up in the punishment room.' />

Some even endure sexual violence. A Taiwanese woman named Alice told us that when she refused to engage in scam work, she was sold numerous times between compounds and repeatedly raped. Before she was finally rescued, the gangsters threatened to lock her up in a brothel-like clubhouse at a scam compound to serve at the pleasure of the managers and workforce. We have also come across stories of male victims who were forced to perform sexual acts on each other as a form of punishment.

Another harrowing aspect of life inside the compounds is the potential to be sold like a slave to the highest bidder.

According to our interviews, skilled workers fluent in Mandarin fetched as much as US$10,000–15,000 (A$16,000–24,000) in Sihanoukville in 2022. In Myanmar, this rate could be double, given the logistical challenges of getting them into a country embroiled in a civil war.

## What happened to Ben and Moira?

For two weeks, Ben and Moira sat at their desks, refusing to make calls.

The threats escalated.

<Pullquote className='' quote='They said […] they would rape my wife if I do not sit and answer phone calls.' />

<Pullquote className='' quote='They tried all kinds of coercive manoeuvres. You know, using a fire extinguisher to [pretend] to hit me to scare me, using a plastic bag over my head to suffocate me.' startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true}/>

Then Ben was separated from his wife. He was forced to sit in a chair facing a wall with a knife positioned between his legs.

The next day, he was moved to a locked room and the scam bosses ordered Ben and Moira to phone their families to demand a US$10,000 (A$16,000) "penalty" each to allow them to walk free. 

<Pullquote className='' quote="It's a combination between a prison and a madhouse. So the walls are like padded with, I think, four-inch pads. If you start screaming in there, no one will be able to hear you." />

<Pullquote className='' quote="And in the room, there's only one railing, which is half a foot above the ground. And basically they handcuffed me on that railing. So I wasn't even able to stand up and they were starving me, depriving me of toilets, water, food." startQuoteIcon={false} endQuoteIcon={true}/>

After eight days, help finally arrived. Ben's father alerted the Malaysian embassy in Phnom Penh, the capital, and the local police intervened. But securing their freedom would still be a distressing ordeal, with the scam centre loathe to let them go.

In [part 2 of our series](https://scam-factories-anatomy-of-a-scam.netlify.app/), published today, we break down the anatomy of a scam. And tomorrow, in part 3, we will explain how the industry has exploded overnight to become a multi-billion-dollar industry.
